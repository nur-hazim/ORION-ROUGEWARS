#An Aliens age is calculated with the following formula: 
#Aliens age = (Age in human years/2 x heigth(m))*3.142
#Write a Python program to solve the problem.
#The program is to prompt user for his human age and height,
#and display the calculated Aliens age.

#print(" ") - display text
#float() - decimal
#int() - whole numbers
#str() - words
#only int and float can be used in calculation
#input() = prompt user
#.format() - fill in arguements with variable
#Math operators:
# + = addition
# - = subtraction
# * = multiplication
# / = division

#Example
#number1 = float(input("Enter first number:"))
#numebr2 = float(input("Enter second numebr:"))
#calculation = number1 + number2
#print("Addition of first number and second number is {}".format(calculation))
