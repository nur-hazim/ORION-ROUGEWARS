#All planets around the universe require a valid passport for entry and insist
#on travellers having a minimum of six months left on their passport for entry.
#Write a Python program to check whether a person's passport is valid for entry.
#The program is to prompt user for the number of months left before his passport
#expires and also the number of months to his intended travel date,
#and display whether he needs to renew his passport or not.
